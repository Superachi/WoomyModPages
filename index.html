      <h1>Welcome to the WoomyMod Wiki!</h1>
      <div class="my-text">
        Here you can find information about the WoomyMod, a <b>fan-made</b> mod for Terraria that adds Splatoon-related content to the game.<br>
        This is my first mod project and "website", so please bear with me :)<br>
        This is a non-profit project, and is <b>unaffiliated with Nintendo</b>. Splatoon belongs to them.<br><br>
    
        <b>Please note:</b> most of the information was generated via code in-game, so it may be incomplete or incorrect.
        Also, unlike a regular wiki, <b>you can't make edits</b>, as this is a static site (using only HTML/CSS, there's no backend to save changes to).
